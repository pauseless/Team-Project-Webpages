					<h2>Rewind the Clock</h2>
					<p>Snapshot's in VirtualBox allow you to save the state of a Virtual Machine. Essentially the way it was exactly functioning at that time</p>
					<p>That means the machine can be reverted back to the time the snapshot was taken after it's suffered a critical failure, lost files, or you did something you didn't mean to do.</p>

					<h3>Be Warned However!</h3>
					<p>Snapshot's use a lot of storage! If you make too many you'll find yourself out of storage very quickly.</p>
